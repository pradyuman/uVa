This program takes in a string input using *fgets* until there are no more strings in *stdin*. For each string, the program loops through every character, checking if the current character is a-z or A-Z and if the next character is not a-z or A-Z. If there is a case that satisfies the above two constraints, a counter is increment. Once the program has looped through the whole string, it prints out the counter (this is the number of words). The program repeats this for the rest of the program.
