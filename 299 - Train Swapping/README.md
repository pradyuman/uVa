This algorithm takes the required input and then starts at the beginning of the input array. It checks to see if the beginning of the input array (index 0)is equal to 1 (index + 1). If so, it moves to the next index. Otherwise it loops through the whole array trying to find the number 1. Once it finds it, it swaps this number with the number to the left (in the array) incrementing a counter at the same time. Once this is done, it repeats the process for the rest of the indexes in the input array.
