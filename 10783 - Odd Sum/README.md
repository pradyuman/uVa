This program calculates the sum of the off numbers within a given bound. The program takes the specified number of test cases and outputs the sum of odd numbers for each case. This sum is calculated in a `while` loop and starts by finding if the lower bound is odd. If it is odd, no change is made, and the lowerbound is incremented by 2 every loop iteration (and the current `lowerBound` is added to the `sum`). If the number is even, then the lowerBound is incremented by one before it is fed into the `while` loop. The remaining process is the same.
