This program increments through the encrypted string and checks to see if the current character in the encrypted string is equal to the current character of the initial message. If they are equal, the index control variable for the initial message and a dummy variable (length) is incremented.

If the dummy variable is equal to the length of the initial message at the end of the loop, the program successfully found the initial message in the encrypted one and "Yes" is returned. Otherwise "No" is returned.
