This program takes in a character from stin until it reaches an EOF character. If the character is not a quotation mark, the program just outputs the character to stdout. If the character from stdin is a quotation, the algorithm increments a counter. The program outputs the respective backtick/single quote depending on whether the counter is even/odd (even is single quotes and odd is backticks).
